    # What is important is that you log the following information from the simulation:
    # Meta data: This shows the starting situtation including:
    #   population, initial infected, the virus, and the initial vaccinated.
    # Log interactions. At each step there will be a number of interaction
    # You should log:
    #   The number of interactions, the number of new infections that occured
    # You should log the results of each step. This should inlcude: 
    #   The population size, the number of living, the number of dead, and the number 
    #   of vaccinated people at that step. 
    # When the simulation concludes you should log the results of the simulation. 
    # This should include: 
    #   The population size, the number of living, the number of dead, the number 
    #   of vaccinated, and the number of steps to reach the end of the simulation.
